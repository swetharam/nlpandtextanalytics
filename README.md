NLP and Text Analytics

Hi there! 
Natural Language Processing is a very interesting field and it can be very confusing sometimes, especially if you are just starting up. 
My blog https://nlpandtextanalytics.blogspot.com/ will your savior in such a conundrum. The code that has been explained elaborately on the website can also be found on this github project folder along with other resources for you to read up and get high on knowledge. 
Shoot me a mail if you have any queries or if you would like to collaborate.
